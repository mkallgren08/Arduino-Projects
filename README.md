### Why we did it
  The impetus for this project came about during the Atlantic hurricane season of 2017. After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, people used social media to broadcast medical emergency information so first responder crews could get to the correct places. And after a double blow from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, Puerto Rico’s infrastructure collapsed – no electricity but what portable generators could make,no running water, and numerous roads wiped away in the waters. The goal of Polaris is twofold: 
1.	We want to teach people how to help themselves in the immediate aftermath of disaster.
2.	We want to set up an easy tracking system for relief crews to get people the help they cannot give themselves.
