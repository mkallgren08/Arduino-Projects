# Welcome to my Arduino Repository
This repo is mainly to serve as a collection of my arduino (and other microcontroller) sketches and as a repo of several of my Maker ideas. There's not much here now, but feel free to come back over time to see what's in here!

For anyone interested in how to get started with learning programming and making your own robots and/or Internet-of-Things devices, head on over to the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), or [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to get started! 

If you're interested in a great starter kit, I would reccomend checking out [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) - they have starter kits for various microcontrollers which include everything you need to get started as well as guides to get you up and running. I would personally recommend the same kit I got started with: the [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit (SIK)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14265) or, of that budget is too steep, check out [this kit from SunFounder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D9NPP1E/ref=sspa_dk_detail_4?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B00D9NPP1E&pd_rd_wg=PAGpR&pd_rd_r=GHC6CKQRD6DVS7SBK6A4&pd_rd_w=rK615).
